-Solve_RMS_Instances.py
This is the main script that runs the designed single-tree search Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) algorithm.

- MILP.py
This is the MIP formulation of the problem.

Master_Problem and different SP files- define different LBBD variants based on the buffer configurations

-Other auxiliary Python files (Extact_Parameters and Lower_Bounds) are used throughout the algorithms and support various functionalities such as model construction and data handling.
